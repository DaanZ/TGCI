        "text": "morning everyone or good afternoon we are about to start and I would like to introduce to you dr. Gerald Kerwin he will provide our opening remarks hi can you hear me yes great welcome everyone to grant writing 101 chasing the mission slides going little slow so so there's a wonderful picture of our great presenters that you'll be able to see soon so we're going to have four sessions and a wrap-up and I'm not going to go through each session but um each session is designed to address a certain aspect of the budget or the grant writing process the first session will be welcome you all and and getting started on the research process grant writing process so why do I care about grant writing and I'm not gonna write any grants right well as a non-profit University we're gonna have an opportunity to make partnerships with other folks do grants of our owns and things like that one thing that we're looking to do is find ways to offer students and faculty opportunities and this is just another step in that what has grant writing done for me lately well you might be surprised that a lot of funding behind the scenes was gathered with a grant of some sort another do I need a research grant to do research do an EDA grant to do research no but it sure does help having money to fund your research that you don't have to pull out of your pocket or from a college budget it's a pretty good thing so we'll get into that later all right do I need a grant to do research the reality is most folks in academic world and in professional practice never actually go for a federal state grant but it's likely that you might get a small one many many graduate students for example Heidi Head is a doctoral student I received a grant to go to conferences you know $500 grant from the college and so you might be surprised at the scope and nature of grants and the things that you'll be able to fund with them so some of the things to consider again I'm not going to go through this whole thing because that's what our whole set of presentations will cover but we're gonna look at the problem we're going to determine you know what is your need what do you need to grant to do your goals and objectives all the activities necessary and you might be surprised at some of them they're not all intuitive and then you're gonna outline a process and these are some of the basic steps or deliverables in a grant so here's some tips and I'm not gonna go through these again fully here because these will come up again in each session but the grant ready takes practice and it takes a team it's very difficult for a single person to create and write a grant little or small and so learning the process learning how organizations do things what their needs are how your needs match to their needs that's some of our goals in these workshops so for example one thing that people don't know is when you write the grant you don't just write a grant of something that's interest to you then you go out and try to sell it to people you want to look for places that are doing similar things that you're doing that have similar mission statement similar needs and so one thing you can do is the person leading that grant federal state foundational or even small grants and say hey here's my idea is it worthwhile to you for me to submit a proposal before you actually do any work so that's the kind of thing we're going to hit on on this researching the grant process we're gonna look at what RFPs are requests for proposals we're gonna look at different types of funding different size grants from from $50 to 5 million where to look for these things and some strategies for finding grants that match what you want to do all right I'm gonna switch to another slide one moment please all right dr. hardy would you like to introduce our can you see that side yeah I'm not sure if it's coming up no we don't see it yet however I'm going to go I'm going to say welcome everyone from those who are near and far those on the East Coast good afternoon we are so excited to be here and let me tell you what we are the grant writing team and so today I would love to introduce to you two people that are going to actually conduct this session we have Olivia Pollard who is a PhD candidate who will actually finish her PhD in October and we have dr. Paul Greenberg and between the both of these two individuals let me tell you a little just a teeny bit about them before we get started collectively they have 11 years of experience in writing grants and collectively as the team we have 76 years of experience in writing grants and so this team is equipped with a lot of information and we're just we're just grateful to be here and I am getting ready to turn it over to the presenters but one thing I want to say to you is that grant writing is not easy and the most difficult part is what you're going to see today is the research part so I am going to now turn it over to the presenters we're excited and we're just looking forward to your presentation today can you see the slides yet we see the slides and they're not in slideshow mode just a moment and I want to ask you all thank you for your patience we are remotely doing and conducting things and we will have this shortly up and for you and the formulating your questions what you think you may want to ask or things you've never been sure about and if it will not be answered in this session it will be answered later but we want to make sure that we definitely get your questions and so I am going to now turn it over to the presenters okay all right everyone I've mellowed out with some smooth jazz and amped up with a couple of quick feet so let's jump right in Darryl you ready now do you see it you sees lines I do oh is that the one that I just sent you I don't know if it is this is the one you just sent me okay okay hello everyone and welcome to the first session of grant writing 101 I'm Olivia Pollard and along with my colleague Paul Greenberg we've created what I hope you'll find to be an entertaining and informative introduction into grant writing in this session we will cover researching the grant process we will touch on we had to look for grants what to work on the different types of grants that are available grant sources some of the search engine search strategies you can use to obtain them and avoiding scams some of the information you may know and some you may not like a little-known fact about grant writing is over fifty billion dollars are awarded by foundations to charitable organizations every year this was cited on the in the article title essential grant writing tips for your nonprofit or in the modern nonprofit comm website or the law requires the information about entities and organizations receiving federal funds to be disclosed to the public via a central website which is usaspending.gov by gov I'm sorry about that this information is published by the grant-making agency and includes the entity's name amount of the grant and funding agency and location we will provide this source and a list of many other resources that we'll talk about in a handout at the end of our presentation this resource will include every link in every prison in every part of our presentation so you don't need to worry about writing them down first I would like to start with a simple little poll are you ready with the poll okay I can launch the poll you want the first one yes has anyone here received the grant and you can just click in yes or no okay I can't control the UM poll so if okay [Music] Wow okay so 32% have received a grant and 68% have not so we're looking to change that after the all four sessions you guys are gonna be experts in grant writing hopefully and those numbers will hopefully change and you'll go out there and you'll see more grants um let's move on to the next slide okay there are many organizations federal entities where you could acquire a grant the two types that are most commonly commonly known are public sector and private sector a simple way to think about this is that from the public sector come from different levels of government whereas grants from the private sector can come from businesses corporations foundations or other non-governmental organizations in each sector you can encounter different types of grants for example the public sector is the part of the US economy that provide various governmental services these agencies are owned and operated by the US government and one of their roles is to provide government grants to both internal and external entities a variety of organizations can apply for these grants but the most important idea to remember is that these grants can come from federal state or local government organizations some examples of these granting organizations would be for federal NSF National Science Foundation the National Science Foundation is an independent federal agency created to promote the progress of science to events the national health prosperity and welfare and to secure the national defense you can read more about them on their website and their website is WWF gov the NSF annually funds approximately 20% of basic federally supported college and university research as I go through a couple of them I'm not going to go into the websites because that's going to be on the handout and you guys can check them out whenever you get a chance the second one would be NIH National Institutes of Health there are a medical research agency and they're making important discoveries that improve health and save lives did you know that NIH is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world investing more than 32 billion a year to enhance life and reduce illness and disability and IH funded research has led to breakthroughs and new treatments helping people live longer healthier lives and build research foundations that drive discovery the next one would be US Department of Health and Human Services of which NIH is a part of we are all familiar familiar with that agency we in the College of Health and the next one being that we're educational the Department of Health and Human Services is the federal government's own principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential Human Services especially to those who are least able to help themselves the US Department of Education ensures equal access to education and promotes educational excellence throughout coordination management and accountability and federal education programs now moving on to state I used to apply annually for a state grant for an organization I used to work for which was NYC hhz better known as New York City Health and Hospitals Corner you might have seen them in the news they're very popular in New York the title of the grant was New York State Archives local government records management Improvement Fund that's a mouthful better known as LGR mif and it was for our document imaging department this allowed us to hire employees to complete the scanning jobs as well as purchase equipment and software for the department the grant started off very large over five million dollars and decreased every year the last grant we applied for we won the highest amount awarded at the time which was one hundred and twenty five thousand dollars so keep in mind if you plan to apply for grants to sustain a project or establish a project the grant reward may not stay the same some some examples of state grants would be since my hometown was New York I took two of those one would be grants to New York community-based organizations to mitigate environmental harms and risks another would be contract for services to a New York nonprofit for support services to elderly people transitioning to community living and let's take California for example grants to California 4-h and FFA programs for agricultural based projects in Imperial County and grants to California nonprofit schools and ages c--'s for community improvement in eligible counties both grants can be looked at as local grants because they are not only specific to the state but certain counties as well so now we're going to move into some local grants the final level of public sector or government grants or local government grants which are state funded grants that can go to entities at the city county township or school level some examples of that would be for New York City a mayor's fund to advance New York City or New York State HSC HSC tuition state program this grant can also be considered for the city and the state and is often used for the city and state colleges and let's take San Diego San Diego one of their grants would be American Association of University Women San Diego scholarships and in the San Diego foundation where if you visit their website which is on the handout you'll see a whole host of a whole host of grants for San Diego residents ok so we can pull up the second poll which is how many of you can name a granting organization that can be found in your state or local region okay so we can take the pole down now let's see what our numbers look like well that's not too bad 38% can and 862 % cannot it's not too bad but we're looking to change that okay so in the private sector you can apply for corporate nonprofit and religious grants to name a few some examples of this would be and I think I have four or five on the list I'm not gonna go through every single one in essence of time okay so one would be 3 M 3 M focuses their corporate grants in areas of education community and environment Bank of America provides nonprofit grants and event sponsor sponsorships with a focus on jobs Workforce Development housing community development and hunger basic basic human services coca-cola focuses on three areas women water and recycling no well-being I'm sorry and in 2016 Washington Post reported how Walmart coca-cola Nestle and Pepsi Cola donated millions of water bottles to help out with the Flint Michigan water crisis um if you'd like to read more on this article the link can be found on a research resource page Family Dollar everyone should be familiar with Family Dollar their corporate Giving Program folks and they focus exclusively upon programs whose purpose is to provide the basic necessities of life to low-income and low middle income families primarily in neighborhoods where their stores are located Jarrell we switched out of the slides you don't see the slide now I see it that's weird okay so the next one would be um Intel the Intel Foundation provides strategic grant support to initiatives that event science technology engineering and math which is the STEM education in communities where the company has significant significant presence and then the last one would be Wells Fargo then they provide community donations to nonprofits and schools environmental initiatives and other corporate citizenship initiatives there'll be a little more I think there may be at least 10 more corporations on the resource handout so look out for that to me this was to name a few so once we're done you can get searching we're going to discuss how to search for grants and who's eligible for grants as the final part of our introduction but before we get into search there is more to know about the grant types this will help narrow your search and give you some insight and so when when it comes from and where it goes here to present this information is my colleague dr. Greenberg take it away Paul hello everybody and thanks so much Olivia welcome it's really good to be here can we go also to the next slide where we have a chance sweet thank you very much now that olivia is giving you a nice overview of some of the total amounts of grant funding available some of the typical funding sources such as US government and private organizations plus some of the specific organizations and websites little this grants I'd like to measure it I'd like to mention a little bit more about the types of grants some of my experience with grants and set the stage for discussing some of our search methods which is the the final part before application but the useful are one of the useful parts here is that well we're gonna share some personal stories the majority of this information that we're in a cover here is hosted online and is going to be listed on our grant supplement so you'll be able to look up a lot of this information on your own just as a brief review you know what really is a grant you know our grant is your source of art not yours but it's a source of money provided by one or more organizations to achieve a range of objectives Jarrell alluded to this earlier that the one of the ways to seek a grant is to try to come up with one of your own ideas and shop around for people who would like to purchase that via grant funding or you can look to see what the organizations need done and try to align what you want to do with what they want to be done there's pros and cons to either of these and some may be typically it's easier to align yourself with what the organization wants but to give some perspective on what the grants actually are what I like to do is just take a look at that infographic and from the infographic we can see that there's four large sources of money including federal state and local government business and philanthropy the size of those clouds give you some idea of which sources have the most total money but this says nothing about the amount of individual award provided by any specific grant from those groups so they can be small in the hundreds to the thousands - much much larger than that all right in addition to these four sources of funding we have different groups who can apply for the funding the typical recipients for these are not-for-profit organizations which has implications for our schools switching to not-for-profit status businesses can apply government agencies themselves can apply and fokin educational organizations it's not a complete list and even leaves out what might be interest to some people here that individuals can apply for some grants the specific information about who can apply for a grant is listed in that grants eligibility criteria and we might have if we have time in the presentation we'll actually look at an example of one of those another piece of information the sources of grants leave out is in the indication of the competitiveness or the worker skills to get grants a lot of people want this money and so there's often stiff competition especially for the first type of government funding which is called discretionary or competitive funding what this means for us is that a grant seeker is going to need to put your best foot forward but also you know I keep in mind to maintain your motivation even if you get rejections rejections are going to be the most common thing most common outcome of a grant application so just gaining experience writing the grants sending them in getting feedback that's highly valuable so it's really good to look at the grant funding process as a long-term goal not as specific I must get this one grant now or it's the end of it if you take a long term view you can build your skills and increase your chances of obtaining these grants okay my own experience getting grants is mostly related to working on NIH funded grants for neuroscience laboratories the way these got funded was to have senior researchers with a good track record of publication head up the efforts and sometimes propose joint work with other researchers what this means for you is that you might consider applying for grants as a team or with other people instead of just on your own even though you may be eligible to apply on your own let's say given the level of competition for the grants yeah here's my plug for something you can do in your classes right now that'll help with grant writing I'd like to use grant writing as an example of why it's important to improve your writing as much as possible and as often as possible you never know when you really might want to apply for a grant but the grant writing time is not when you want to worry about the writing skills so if you can as much as you can do to work on your writing skills and classes right now is something that it's gonna be great to get these to prepare yourself for writing a grant given the nature of how competitive the grants are even grammatical errors will be criteria that funding agencies might use to choose somebody else's grant all right so now that we now we've seen a little bit of some of these basic ideas about grants I think for overall perspective I want to mention the four major types of grants that we can look at the first is discretionary and competitive grants and these are the ones that perhaps the majority of us will be applying to for these competitive funding you obtain this funding by competing through different funding agencies and the agencies award those grants based on how attractive that funding panel views your project and in comparison to other projects a second type of grant is called formula funding and this is a mandatory grant legislatively determined that says that a certain amount of money must go to certain types of work while I doubt the majority of us will be working under a formula funding it's still possible and it's good to know about these grants because smaller organizations may use some of this funding to fund grants that you could apply for a third category these grants is called continuation funding and this is essentially the lifeblood of any research laboratory once you get an initial grant that's your startup that's a that's a big win and if you can use the success that you have based on the outcome or the output of your first grant to apply for continuation funding how you turn a single grant into either a long lasting project or a career it's a lot of academics based their career on continuation funding programs many community programs are completely dependent on continuation funding so it's just good to know about this because when you write a grant you can look at it as a one-off grant maybe it's a travel grant or you get to present at a conference or you can look at it as you're really applying you'd like to get a sequence of grants to fund a long-term project perhaps a research project or in your community so it's just good to know about these the fourth one is called pass-through funding and this is just another source of funding that can be federal and state governments can use for either competitive funding or a formula funding and the reason I wanted to mention all these is that it tells us that we can search for both federal and state websites for grant announcements and opportunities but while you're looking at these opportunities it's good to keep an eye on what type of funding that it is a fifth type of the funding that we have is ones that's specifically related to student AIDS such as the Pell Grant which can provide about six thousand dollars a year and a baseline financial financial need however I'm gonna leave it to our Office of Financial Aid to explain the other options about student financial aid so that covers one chunk of funding which is government funding and then our next category of funding is private funding and the two types of grants that we're gonna see with private funding are those that provide general purpose support for your program that's called the operating support and then the second type is program or project specific support the reason I wanted to mention those is when you have a general purpose support that gives you a lot of flexibility and it shows that the organization has a lot of faith in what you're doing if you have only project support or specific program support that funding tells you exactly what can be how much can be spent and exactly on what so if you do a good job at your project and program support it may be possible to work your way up towards getting more general general purpose support okay so can we go on to the next slide now it also a good time too if you have any questions about the grant process or what we said so far put them in the chat for us and we'll start collecting these at the end we'll save some time for question and answer with this next idea what I wanted to mention is that if you go to Ashford WWH for edu tuition financial aid payments options scholarships and grants if you go to that website or you google search for Ashford dot edu tuition and financial aid you can see a variety of different options that Ashford offers us we also recently received an email about University of the Rockies completion of grant so if you haven't yet seen that email and that applies to you that's worth looking for so I just wanted to mention that Ashford itself offers a variety of different grants okay next slide if you would please Jarrell alright so what we have now is understanding the different sources of money and the different types of grants generally now we would like to look start looking at grant search strategy so with grad search strategy there's basically two you can try to fund your own specific idea or you can look for the existing requests for proposals we highly recommend working on the second one looking for existing requests for proposals not only is that going to be not only will that more quickly align with what funding organizations want but it should also be easier to find those grants if you're just shopping around for a place to to sell your own idea for a project that you want funded may not be clear where that fits whereas if you look for existing requests for proposals those come from specific agencies and they have many detailed criteria about who can apply and where to actually do that so when we start looking for when we start looking for grants typically people will look on government websites so we've got grants.gov and we've got a search engine called grants for word in addition to those government websites that we can look on there's just a large number and an ever-changing number of foundation websites corporate websites and private websites that will offer a surprising range of funding opportunities professional Society websites will also have this for your search strategy this should be familiar to many online students you know what do we do or familiar to a lot of people period what do we do to search for this information most people will typically begin with a Google search and that's fine you can look for your specific ideas you can type in the word grants that's also where it gets a little bit dangerous because and Olivia will touch on this when we talk about scams there's a lot of different scams the target people who are searching for grants so when you do a general internet search you're gonna have to do you're gonna have to pay attention to what's real and what is fake which makes the second search strategy looking at a grant search engine such as grants.gov makes that much safer because that brings you directly to government grants with actual eligibility criteria so once you have once you know where to start searching for the grants either general internet search or specific grant search engines like grants.gov then we begin to work on your keywords and the delimiters so your keywords are gonna determine if you find a grant and then the delimiters are basically going to make that grant search more efficient again if you have questions at this point please add them into the chat box and let's see I think Olivia would you like to start off with your tips for grant search from here short ball I'll take over all right okay that's right for Google because if Google said it then it must be right it must be true right when using a search engine like Google or Bing or Yahoo any type of search engine you can input input search terms such as scholarships fellowships RFPs for your specific criteria and RFP is a request for proposal or grants for your specific criteria you can also look to your state and or local government websites the school you work for or ten I recently applied to and won a grant at the school I'm attending so it is possible to achieve professional society as polls mcpaul mentioned earlier networking networking is a very good way of getting into the grant writing arena and seeing what's out there corporate websites like Apple Amazon Google Walmart Target etc you'll see a whole lot of them they're ready to give away their money so you can take it apply for it Matthew Lesko website his name is old but he is still kicking and his website is kept up to date and he's at www.canadianoutback.com that are available to apply for there are also websites that host grant databases some you'll have to pay a fee for or to access the information and some are for free so here are a few the Foundation Center the catalog of federal domestic assistance grants gov which Paul mentioned a little while ago guidestar guidestar provide information on all kinds of nonprofits including foundations you can register for free and use the advanced search capabilities to find the 990-pf of foundations the form 990-pf titled return of private foundation is essentially a tax return that must be filed each year with the Internal Revenue Service by organizations exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501 of the IRS code and whose annual receipts are normally more than $25,000 a year it's been said in the grant writing industry that if you know if you you are able if you know you're a grant writer whenever you're able to read a 990 form and understand it that's a little grant writing humor the next database would be the grantsmanship Center there's a map on the US we're clicking on the state brings up links to top grant-making foundations Community Foundation's corporate giving programs and a state website homepage the community foundation locator is sponsored by the council Foundation and their website displays a map of the US as well and it also lists its local community foundations and links to those foundation sites The Chronicle of philanthropy is an excellent source of news on the foundation and nonprofit world and there is a grant database there you do have to subscribe however the access to the database there are a limited number of articles for free okay big online is a for-profit research resource that provides online and telephone assistance for navigating the various tools on your websites and they also offer online classes to learn more about the features of this extensive database which contains a 990s of many funders don't underestimate how much great information you can find in a tax return okay grantstation this allows our grant seekers to identify potential funding sources for their programs or projects and mentors mentors them through the process instrumental is one last one they put nonprofit grant search on autopilot nonprofits provide basic information about their programs and projects and instrumental matches them with relevant funding opportunities and helps to manage their process it's a paid subscription but they promise the safety dozens of hours and thousands of dollars that you might otherwise spend tracking down the best leads on your own okay so um let's go to the next slide okay scams avoiding scams oh yes there are scams everywhere even here individuals preying on people looking to fund projects causes organizations are prime targets here are a few ways to avoid them be leery of anyone Reese reaching out to you specifically of eligibility news more than likely this is a scam the government and other grantees will not seek you out to offer you a grant you must seek them out and apply if you are asked to send money to get the grant it's a scam you should not have to pay money to get money or else why would you need the grant the grant does not require an application or me or way for you to apply false all grants will require an application these applications are kept on file and used to determine the winner of the grant if you never submit an application they don't know what you want and they don't even know who you are okay and the last one would be you have mysteriously won a grant that you did not apply for or that you spend you can spend without reporting there are no grant drawings you can win out of the blue you must apply yourself because there is information you would have to provide when doing so when you apply for the grant the grantor will have strict stipulations on how to grant should be used okay so we will provide for websites in the handout you can visit to read more about avoiding grant scams such how to avoid grant scams on a Health and Human Services website NIH s grant scams podcast and grants.gov where they have a plethora of information for you on grant writing on a grant writing process and how to report scams that you might have been contacted by okay so I think we're on to the next slide should be our last slide okay all right um so for this slide um I guess we're going to conclude Paul and I had wonderful time working on this session for you all and I hope you enjoyed the presentation please send us any questions or put questions in the in the chat any feedback and links to all the resources in the presentation can be found on the PDF file that we're going to send out or attach thank you for attending and now if it if there's any questions if we have time if you have questions for Paul only now just kidding you can ask us both questions if you have questions now ask them if there are no questions then Paul has a search demo he'd like to show time permitting so take it away Paul let's see first are there any questions Olivia this is this is Nina there's a question in the chat do you want to discuss matching funds matching funds I don't want to discuss that I think that might be covered in one of our future sessions okay what's the what's the question about matching funds it just says do you want to discuss matching funds oh I think yeah that'd probably be best for a future session okay that's the only question I see currently in the chat let me ask a question of the audience does the audience feel like applying for a grant is daunting and out of reach or it's something that you can do forgive everybody a few seconds to cogitate on that comments are coming through saying yes it's doable but it's still daunting intimidating I feel that way too the grants that I worked on were huge it took multiple career researchers quite a long time to put those together they got the money but I'm like wow it's tough to do on your own but then I compared that to what a 20 year old friend of mine said when we were all about 20 she's like oh I'm good at writing grants I get them I get them pretty easily I just looked at it I thought what what grants and how much she's like oh you know I got $10,000 to do an educational program well with Native Americans on their reservation it's like part of an outdoor outdoor education program she just quickly wrote the grant got 10 grand and you know explained it like it was nothing to her so from one hand you know some grants are difficult to get and other grants I think are quite within reach of people with perhaps even no formal training on it I don't know her parents were they did work for the government the Forest Service so as possible they gave her some information about how to about proper documentation but she's just liked to write grants and was successful getting them before and this is while she was in college so she hadn't even graduated yet so I would just like to put it out there that you know if you know when in doubt if you want to put the time into the grant application do it you know you would never it's an opportunity that you would not have unless you actually did it there's another question that came through Lynn asks does it depend on the grant organizations or do some require more detail than others I would absolutely say that some require more detail than others what sure did you want to Olivia did you want to talk to that no I was just saying for sure um because when I applied for grants such as the well the city and state grant for the organization that I was working for they required 10 copies of each application with accompanying paperwork and I think the whole packet for each 10 packets would be 20 pages of peace whereas when I applied for the grant on my own it was maybe five pages long and I only had to provide one copy they did ask for a lot of information both of them I'm not gonna lie you will be writing and typing and researching and you will have to provide a lot of information but it's well worth it to see it when you definitely win that grant cuz you guys gonna win a grant so that's all I wanted to add well yeah I think that's fantastic uh just just considering what we've said already today from the largest government grants down to the smallest community grants even down to the grants that individual people want to put out there in memorial to their friends family or loved ones those will take on a wide variety of different of level of detail in the application some maybe only a few pages cuz the 10 the 10 copies is outrageous but so there is many grant that I would say that there's probably a grant to fit every type of every type of person from the very smallest grants to require the least documentation to the largest ones where you're gonna need some help with that most likely but the grants really are feasible we have over 30% of people here on just this conference call who've gotten some sort of a grant I got a grant at the University of Arizona was the neuroscience training grant and those those were given out to people based on their interests and their their promise so we had five of those go to the incoming class I got one of them and so I think I had two I'm not even sure it was so long ago I'm not sure I had to apply for it my advisor may have applied for it but grants are within reach many people get these and there's such a wide variety that if you're interested in funding looking for funding for your projects or to work with other organizations it's a whole ecosystem to start getting in touch with what's out there most people I would say most people don't even know what's out there I don't know many of the grants are out there but there's so many from the Bill Gates Foundation all the way down to you know your neighbor somebody's neighbor out there could be the source of a grant if they have a small business or if they have their own nonprofit organization so just just you never know what you'll find unless you actually do the looking Paul while we have a few minutes do you want to do the lab starts demo so you can show them what it looks like yeah I'll go ahead and do that this is a live search so I don't know what we're gonna what we're gonna find well start off with one of the more detailed ones so I'll just go ahead and look at the government grants on the government webpage and I'll start let me do I want to switch to my screen sharing I'm gonna try it okay so the fastest way that people are going to get to Grant's is probably your internet search agent search engine so I just googled for government grant search and it brings you to home grants.gov open up open this up in a new tab brings you to their lovely Facebook look-alike grants.gov nice blue website and it gives you a couple search options you can just search directly from the search bar which is nice or you can click the search grants button I'll just go ahead and do that hopefully there's not much of a delay here does everybody seen the screen yes that's the air pool okay thanks Olivia well so I'll search as you can see it is gonna begin with a keyword or if you're savvy maybe you have an opportunity opportunity number so let's just see what comes up with educational because we're all interested in education in some way it also allows you to have some delimiter 'z forecaster grants are posted so I'm just going to limit it to posted that cuts down what we have and then what you see is just a list of the posts of each opportunity and probably what we'll look for is the opportunity title excuse me US aid see forest health sounds interesting to me I don't know if that's interesting to you but my friend who is adaptive getting the grants from local agencies for community and education parents work with the Forest Service so another thing to look is when's the closing date the August 10th so most likely we're not going to be able to apply for that this year but just for instructional purposes let's take a look at it so now what this brings you into is the detailed in from information for the grant and here's where you would actually start learning how the government describes these grants so for first-time grant searchers it's gonna be important just to look through each of these different fields what are these it's discretionary funding so that's the first type a competitive discretionary funding is the first type of funding that we discussed so now you know that you're gonna have to compete with others for this and hopefully it'll be based on merit but a lot of grants are based on what's the hot topic of the moment you really have to appeal to people's interests it's not just if your idea is good it's if your idea is good and timely and has the backing or if there's enough interest in it from from this probably the next thing that we're most interested in is eligible eligibility criteria so it looks says that you're gonna have to look for extra information and this announcement is not a request for applications it's to provide public notice the Park Service's intention to award financial assistance on the next project activities so if we're looking for something that we want to apply to directly this would not be it so we can you now see that it's gonna take some work to sort through what grant opportunities exist pause here for a second do we have any questions about your grant search at this point Paul this Jarrell I can add to that public notice always comes out a few months before the RFP they always do that to give people plenty of time to start looking and searching and then the official RFP will come out probably three to six months after that notice and jerry' let me quiz you on this because this is fun so when did you find when did you find out that that's how the grant process works when I took a grant writing class and graduate school okay so when you took a grant writing class in graduate school and are these something that we're going to be covering in future sessions yes fantastic so now everybody you see why it's important to show up for the next sessions there's much information to get through here but that information is critical helps you interpret what it is that you're seeing cool wait we have six minutes do you want to go to another website really quickly well we have we need to sum up - so I'm gonna be cognizant of people's time yeah I think things we're gonna cover in future sessions so thank you very much yeah just one quick search and then let's go - back to you Durrell oh yeah yeah I'll take it thank you Olivia and Paul very much for this is some good information there's a couple of questions I wanted to hit on there real quickly how long do postings stay open as long as they have money sometimes two or three years it just depends on the grandpa who's giving out the grant so that's a great question so if you're not affiliated with the organization typically you would do the search that Paul just did and you would find I like to find those postings before they are because once the RFP is out you've got some competitors with the posting nobody's competing against you and so what I would do is I'd click at the bottom of that page and there's a person's name there a contact person usually the the grant administrator and I would contact them and say here's my idea do you think this is a good idea and they'll say yes or no they're usually pretty candid about it and then you proceed from there and it gets your name not there anyway some of these strategies we'll cover later I want to say that our next session we're gonna start talking about doctors Hardy and Harper we're gonna talk about needs assessment goals and objectives and some of these methods for these activities I can also say that from personal experience I recently had a $500 grant it was a teaching and learning grant in it and it took me two paragraphs in a few minutes to sin and I've also worked a multi-million dollar grant for the Department of Energy and IA and that took nine months to write the grant a team of ten scientists and and PhD folks and it was two hundred and thirteen pages I could have I can even send you a copy of it if you want most people don't share their grant proposals because it's competitive and we often use the same stuff more than warts but this is a grant I would never go for again so I pretty sure but it took nine months to write the grant so interesting stuff and yeah so did you know Katherine's question we are looking in the future to get small grants medium sized grants maybe large grants partner with other universities the the field is open one of the goals one of my goals is that there are people out in the world doing research and now that we're going to be nonprofit I can say can I be a part of your research even if I don't submit my own grant I can I can collaborate with folks in other universities and institution so there's a lot of things coming up and a lot of our future sessions will touch on that any last questions Jarrell there's a whole bunch in the chat now one specifically for for Paul how long do those postings stay open welcome two to three years okay and then Katherine asks if we are not currently affiliated with an organization would it be helpful to find an organization and then go for a grant act the organization yeah that's what I was just hitting on weekend yeah I didn't know you were monitoring the chat yeah yeah yeah I thought I'd missed them so that's good - two hours of more than one or four eyes or whatever yeah four eyes potential reasons we want to pursue grants money but it's not just money it's you know we want to fund so for example I might want to get a grant to fund my research or I might want to start working on a diversity project with dr. hardy where we find first-generation students who who don't typically pursue college we write them grants so we could get a grant to give grants I mean there's so many things that grants can do but it's all about money money Latanya exactly money is opportunity it's an opportunity for us to do things it's also an opportunity for us to provide others things and that's what those corporate partnerships that Paul touched on are about is that we get money from corporations or we get assistance or connections to organizations and we help students and so what is our ultimate goal here to advance our fields to help students and to provide those Lysanias GracePoint opportunities I want to add one more word here and that word is community so if you search for a Community Grants you'll start to see just how much stuff is actually going on in your community who's organizing it and what gets funded so you can do doesn't have to be educational it can just be community building in a variety of really interesting ways so I would search for that if you're curious about what you can do with grant money yeah there are so many opportunities out there I mean just search for your local nonprofit organization usually there's a local chapter or some sort of social connection and in search for nonprofits in your area I work for occasionally do some volunteer work for the Denver nonprofit association who has oh they have over a hundred and fifty member companies and organizations and they write thousands of grants each year and actually I wrote their grant writing handbook which I can also send you Pamela I just want to add one more thing before we let everyone go we have approximately were over time I want to say this what we are showing you today and we want to thank Olivia and Paul for their time but what we want to say to you today this is a basic grant writing course you may be able to go out and do something with this home your home your skills but we want to give you the basics so I many people will go away and be able to do something with this well we just want you to say this is a start to get your foot in the door so from everybody here we just want to thank you for your time thank you Paul and Olivia you did a fantastic job Nina thank you for monitoring the chat Jarrell any last words then we will let you go you said it so eloquently I can't answer that well we thank you we were looking forward to seeing everyone on August the 14th and just thank you everyone everyone any other questions please put them in the chat and we will ensure that you get your response that thank you everyone have a great day",
        "summary": "The grant writing workshop, titled \"Grant Writing 101: Chasing the Mission,\" was introduced by Dr. Gerald Kerwin, who emphasized the importance of grant writing for non-profit universities. He highlighted that while not everyone in academia or professional practice may pursue federal or state grants, many might encounter smaller grants that can significantly aid in funding research or attending conferences. The workshop aimed to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the grant writing process, including identifying the problem, determining needs, setting goals and objectives, and outlining a process for grant writing. Dr. Kerwin also shared tips for successful grant writing, such as the importance of practice, teamwork, and aligning one's needs with those of potential funding organizations.\n\nThe session was led by Olivia Pollard, a PhD candidate, and Dr. Paul Greenberg, both of whom have extensive experience in grant writing. They covered various aspects of researching the grant process, including where to look for grants, the different types of grants available, and strategies for finding grants that match one's objectives. They discussed the distinction between public sector grants, which come from different levels of government, and private sector grants, which can come from businesses, corporations, foundations, or other non-governmental organizations. The presenters also highlighted the importance of understanding the eligibility criteria for different grants and the need to align one's project with the interests of the funding organization.\n\nIn addition to discussing the types of grants and funding sources, the workshop addressed the importance of avoiding scams in the grant application process. Participants were advised to be cautious of unsolicited offers, requests for money to secure a grant, and grants that do not require an application. The session concluded with a live search demonstration by Dr. Greenberg, who showed participants how to navigate grant search engines like grants.gov. The workshop emphasized the importance of persistence and practice in grant writing, encouraging participants to view the process as a long-term goal rather than a one-time effort. The session ended with a Q&A, where participants were encouraged to ask questions and share their experiences with grant writing."
